pyhds
============
This is a very incomplete python library for downloading streams
in the Adobe HDS format, heavily inspired by K-S-V's AdobeHDS.php
(https://github.com/K-S-V/Scripts/blob/master/AdobeHDS.php).
It is a work in progress, as is my understanding of HDS streams
and the Adobe Flash Video file format, and a lot of this code will
change.

tl;dr: Move on and pay no attention to this mess.
